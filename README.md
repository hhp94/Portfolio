# Portfolio.
This github showcases my works from a combination of academic courses as well as
personal projects. The directories are as follows:  

- [data](./data): This folder contains the public data used for the source codes.  
- [source_code](./source_code): This folder contains the source codes of the 
publications in the publication folder.  
- [publication](./publication): This folder contains the .pdf outputs of the 
source codes that are easier to read.
	1. [Implementation of LASSO Logistic Regression](./publication/LASSO_logistic_regression.pdf)
	2. [Data quality control report](./publication/Data-Quality-Control-Report.pdf)
